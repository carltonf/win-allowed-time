Windows 7/8 style allowed time table
----------------

Aim to provide a familiar way to pick allowed time frames for Windows 10 users,
who wants to use =net= command to set up time limit instead of having to create
an account for the "degraded" new parental control in Windows 10.

An alpha version is available at [[http://carltonf.github.io/win-allowed-time/][win-allowed-time]]. The main functionality should work.

* todo
- [ ] update the style to use [[https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric][OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric]], it's a tool intended
  for win 10 use anyway.
- [ ] Modularize Event and listeners part.
- [ ] Get rid of d3 dependency.
- [ ] Optionally save user settings to 3rd repo/dropbox.
- [ ] create a win 10 app using JS/HTML mode.
